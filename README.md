Creating the simple calculator web application was a great beginner project. It helped me grasp the basics of web development, from designing a user-friendly interface to writing code that handles basic arithmetic operations. I learned how to structure a project, debug issues, and manage data efficiently. Overall, it was a valuable experience that gave me confidence to take on more complex projects in the future.
